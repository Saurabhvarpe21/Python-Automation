      "unsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman's favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . \n",
      "comments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . \n",
      "their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they're typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . \n",
      "stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he's rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . \n",
      "other than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . \n",
      "stalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . \n",
      "interspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it's implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . \n",
      "after these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . \n",
      "the narrator states that \" this is the story of daryl gleason \" and tells the audience that he is the stalker . \n",
      "of course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . \n",
      "if the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . \n",
      "okay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . \n",
      "stalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . \n",
      "the opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . \n",
      "daryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . \n",
      "ultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . \n",
      "these plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . \n",
      "for some reason , this genre's films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . \n",
      "stalked is no exception ( it's a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . \n",
      "events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you'll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . \n",
      "stalked's cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . \n",
      "jay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . \n",
      "he overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . \n",
      "maryam d'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the \" stalked \" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . \n",
      "brooke ( d'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . \n",
      "toward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . \n",
      "to ensure he won't use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . \n",
      "does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? \n",
      "of course not . \n",
      "she tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . \n",
      "when daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . \n",
      "somehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . \n",
      "the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience's suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character's intelligence . \n",
      "stalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . \n",
      "rated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . \n",

      "mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film's budget ) . \n",

      "the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony . \n",

      "instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars . \n",
      "because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination . \n",
      "the story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback . \n",
      "ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black . \n",
      "carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat . \n",
      "sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup . \n",
      "the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss . \n",
      "his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring . \n",
      "these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience . \n",
      "somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights . \n",
      "within a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars . \n",
      "after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by . \n",
      "i rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n",

      "their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they're typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . \n",

      "the story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback . \n",
      "ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black . \n",
      "carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat . \n",
      "sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup . \n",
      "the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss . \n",
